  contents:
    - title: Software Engineering
      items:
        - Leading the design and the development of a NLP-based web-application for context-aware spell-checking based on Flask and Javascript.
    - title: Internet Performance Analysis
      items: 
        - Conduct research for mobile-network traffic classification using a distributed deep learning framework (Horovod) on a Spark cluster.
    - title: Machine Learning
      items: 
        - Design and implementation of a predictor for a solar panel energy production forecasting on the basis of weather conditions, training data using Random Forest algorithm.
    - title: Network Security
      items:
        - Generation and propagation of a Trojan malware using Metasploit and SEToolkit tools on a Kali Linux OS. The malware could avoid AV static and dynamic analysis and tested on a Windows OS, after being embedded in a Windows installer using the NSIS tool.
    - title: Datacenter Networks
      items:
        - Implementation of the ECMP protocol using software defined networking on a leaf-spine topology, built using the Mininet tool. The control plane was deployed using a Ryu controller and the OpenFlow protocol.
    - title: Computer Systems
      items:
        - Implementation and of a client-server application for workload analysis and load balancing of incoming HTTP requests. A server pool was deployed using Microsoft Azure. The communication has been tested using the Jmeter tool and each virtual machine has been provided with an Apache web server.

  contents:
    - title: Network traffic matrix estimation using AI-based computer vision techniques
      items: 
       - Development an AI system based on computer vision algorithms (i.e., super-resolution) that can accurately estimate fine-grained network traffic matrix from aggregated measurements, which can provide valuable insights into network performance and help identify potential bottlenecks or security threats.
    - title: Routing using Deep Reinforcement Learning and Graph Convolutional Networks.
      items: 
        - Design, implementation, and evaluation of innovative approaches for network routing based on Deep Reinforcement Learning. Single-Agent Graph Convolutional Network could help to minimize retraining needs, whereas Multi-agent Deep Q-Networks could provide scalable alternatives where multiple federated domain routing agents need to cooperate, e.g., in eBGP or other Wide Area Networks under a single domain
    - title: Mobile Traffic Prediction using Multitask Deep Learning.
      items:
        - Comparison and discussion of advanced DL-based prediction models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, Gated Recurrent Unit, Long Short-Term Memory and their performance to predict highly dynamic coarse-grained encrypted mobile-app traffic using flow-level statistics.
