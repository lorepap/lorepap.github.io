<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.

I am a PhD student in Computer Science under the advisement of Dr. Flavio Esposito, at Saint Louis University, where I am part of the Networking Research Group (NRG). My research interests are Machine Learning Systems, Datacenter Networks and Network Optimization.

My research can be divided in two areas: one is exploring the design and deployment of DL/ML models for network optimization tasks; a second area is distributed DL training acceleration using in-network computing. Some of my recently published work and ongoing projects are specifically investigating: reinforcement learning for congestion control, super-resolution for traffic matrix estimation, in-network machine learning and in-network aggregation (INA) for distributed deep learning.

<!-- I have always been drawn to the complexity of computer networks and how they enable our daily lives. My passion for this field inspired me to pursue a PhD, where I can delve into the intricacies of these systems and contribute to their improvement. I believe that the combination of Machine Learning and Networking can lead to breakthroughs in our understanding and management of communication networks. -->

<!-- In my free time, I enjoy engaging in various physical and creative activities. Soccer is one of my favourite sports, but I also workout regularly at the gym. I have 10+ years of experience in playing electric guitar. Photography is another hobby of mine, and I love capturing moments and memories through my lens.

Overall, I am driven by my passion for Computer Science and my desire to make a difference in the field of Networking. I look forward to continuing my research journey and contributing to the academic community through my work. -->
